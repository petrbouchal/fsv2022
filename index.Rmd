class: left, middle, medium

.pull-left[

Led strategy and evaluation units at Ministry of Reg. Dev't, Prague IPR, & a consulting firm

Do external analysis for government and NGO's, mostly using public data

]

.pull-right[

Also do research on government: Czech Priorities, IDEA CERGE-EI, ex-Institute for Government (UK)

Projekt PANK: supporting analytical capacities in gov

]

class: left, middle, large

 1\. Looking at evidence a good way to think through how gov't works

--

 2\. You can find yourselves in researcher / gov analyst roles

--

 3\. Knowledge of PA concepts helps explain puzzles about policy & evidence

# Some core questions

---
class: left, middle, large

 # 1\. What is policy?

---
class: large

# Some provocations

- not just what politicians decide
- one policy â‰  one place in government
- does not happen in a linear way
- blurry line between "policy" and "implementation"

---
class: left, middle, large

 # 2\. What is evidence?

---
class: large

# Some provocations

- not just research
- (what is good evidence?)
- what questions? ("What works?" Any others?)
- what researchers consider evidence x what gov considers
- useful term? What about "knowledge"? "Learning?"

---
class: left, middle, large

 # 3\. Why is evidence not used?

---
class: left, middle, large

# Some ideas

- a gap between two worlds?
- a supply x demand mismatch?
- an organisational issue? psychological factors?
- a skills issue?
- misunderstanding how policy works?
- how useful is learning from medicine, public health, education?
- cf. knowledge brokering, policy labs

---
class: large

# Trying to help: project hypotheses

--
- work at the team level
--

- address processes, ways of working, not just structures and skills
--

- some evidence on what works for getting evidence used, not much on improving "evidence work" generally in practice
--

- adapt existing good practices, learn from what happens

---
class: medium

# What does it look like in the wild?

- wide variety of evidence work and organisational setups: from data teams to policy & admin teams

--

- few overarching standards for "evidence work"
  - no official recognition of "analyst" as a role or profession
  - ditto for "evidence use" as a basic skill of a public official
  - emerging bottom-up professional community
  - many analytical roles only within ad-hoc projects
  
---
class: medium

# What does it look like in the wild? cont'd

- islands of excellence for specific types of evidence work
--

- lots of "small" policy at working/operational level
- much potential in using evidence to improve implementation and connect parts of the system, build feedback loops

---
class: large

# For the budding public officials: what kinds of skills are needed?

- doing basic policy analysis
- user focus, user/stakeholder engagement & rsrch
- whole system thinking
- evidence literacy, evidence synthesis
- data literacy and data analysis skills
- data and knowledge management
- management skills and habits
